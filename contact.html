	<h1>A little more about me</h1>
	<p>I have gained valuable experience in both customer service and technical support roles, where I honed my problem-solving and communication skills.</p>
	<p>My background includes working as a business assistant and receptionist, roles that strengthened my ability to multitask and handle various challenges efficiently. </p>
	<p>Currently, I work as a specialist at an Apple Store, where I provide customers with guidance on Apple products and services. This role has allowed me to develop a deeper understanding of user experience and technology integration.</p> 
	<p>My goal is to advance to the Genius Bar to gain hands-on experience with hardware and software troubleshooting, further enhancing my technical expertise.</p>
	<p>Long-term, I aspire to transition into a software development role at Apple, contributing to projects that shape the future of immersive technology.</p>
	<p>By leveraging my interdisciplinary background, I aim to create intuitive and engaging digital experiences that seamlessly integrate technology into everyday life.</p>
	

	<p> Thank You! :)</p>
